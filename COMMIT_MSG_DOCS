feat: Overhaul documentation and implement Chat History

This commit consolidates recent work on documentation and the Chat History
extension.

**Documentation**:
- Rewrote root and `slircd-ng` READMEs to explicitly define the project
  as a "Research IRC Ecosystem" with a "No Users, No Mercy" philosophy.
- Detailed the 4 Core Innovations: Typestate Protocol, CRDT Linking,
  Observability, and Capability Security.
- Updated Quickstart and Architecture sections.

**Features**:
- **Chat History**: Implemented full support for IRCv3 `CHATHISTORY`.
  - Added `src/db/history.rs` for SQLite-backed message storage.
  - Updated `PrivmsgHandler` to persist messages to the database.
  - Implemented `CHATHISTORY` command handler with `BEFORE`, `AFTER`,
    and `LATEST` targeting.
- **Registration**: Moved `REGISTER` command to `UniversalHandler` to
  allow account registration at any connection state.

**Database**:
- Added `migrations/003_history.sql` to create `messages` and `targets` tables.

**Refactoring**:
- Cleaned up `messaging` module structure.
- Updated `Registry` dispatch logic.
