docs: Identify project as AI-driven proof of concept

Updated the root README and `slircd-ng` README to explicitly state that
this ecosystem is an "AI Research Experiment" and a "proof of concept
execution of a test using AI to develop software."

This clarifies the project's purpose as a testbed for AI coding
capabilities rather than a production-intent software product.
